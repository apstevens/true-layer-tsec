Challenge for True Layer

Good morning Rory,

Thank you for your email.

You are receiving the 409 response because there is a conflict preventing you from accessing the target source.  In this case the conflict is likely due to you trying to carry out two separate calls in parallel using the same user access token.  Because these calls are being submitted simulatneously the server cannot determine which call to action.

This has been implemented to improve performance and limit conflicts.

Kind regards
Andy
